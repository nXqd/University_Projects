This is the project I and my friend have done in University.
The program written in C# can interact with MCB2300 board. Program in board written in Keil 3.
Features:
	1. Input / output text
	2. Play a song [beep beep]
	3. Reset board 
	4. Send current time

It's still quite simple, so I would be very happy if you guys fork and give comments to my project.
